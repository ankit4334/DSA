 1) What is Java?
 ans:-Java is the high-level, object-oriented, 
 robust, secure programming language, platform-independent, 
 high performance, Multithreaded, and portable programming language. 
 It was developed by James Gosling in June 1991. It can also be known 
 as the platform as it provides its own JRE and API.

 directly,that's why you need t compile your *.java files to obtain *.class
 file that contain the bytecodes understandable by the JVM.
 
 2.JRE(JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT):-The java runtime environment(JRE) provides the
 libraries,the java virtual machine, and other components to run appets and applications written in the java programming language.
 JRE does not contain tools and utilities such as compilers or debuaager for developing applets and applications.

 3.JDK(JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT):-The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. 
 It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.

 keyword are the reserved words that are specific to a programming language.

 2.Identifers:-

 some certain rules for naming identifiers;

 ->variable:-
 variable is used to store values. values store in it can be changed

 for example:-int a,float b,int,a,b;


 ->Data types:-
 A datatype defines the type of data a variable will store.
 for example:int float char double,long,boolean.
 There are two types of data types in Java:
 1.Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
 2.Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

 Why does Java not support pointers?
 ans:-
 The pointer is a variable that refers to the memory address.
 They are not used in Java because they are unsafe(unsecured) and complex to understand.

Count Digits
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 30.45%Submissions: 254K+Points: 2
Given a number n. Count the number of digits in n which evenly divide n. Return an integer, total number of digits of n which divides n evenly.

Note :- Evenly divides means whether n is divisible by a digit i.e. leaves a remainder 0 when divided.
 

Examples :

Input: n = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: 1, 2 when both divide 12 leaves remainder 0.
Input: n = 2446
Output: 1
Explanation: Here among 2, 4, 6 only 2 divides 2446 evenly while 4 and 6 do not.
Input: n = 23
Output: 0
Explanation: 2 and 3, none of them divide 23 evenly.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1<= n <=105

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {

       
        
        int s=0;
        while(x!=0){
            int k=x%10;
            if(s>Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 || s<Integer.MIN_VALUE/10){
                return 0;
            }
            s=s*10+k;

9. Palindrome Number
Solved
Easy
Topics
Companies
Hint
Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1


class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
       if(x<0){
           return false;
       }
        int k=x;
         long long int sum=0;
       while(x!=0){
         int k=x%10;
         sum=sum*10+k;

       }

        if(sum==k){

Sum of all divisors from 1 to n
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 43.37%Submissions: 135K+Points: 2
Given a positive integer N., The task is to find the value of Î£i from 1 to N F(i) where function F(i) for the number i is defined as the sum of all divisors of i.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
Output:
15
Explanation:
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1 + 2 = 3
F(3) = 1 + 3 = 4
F(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
ans = F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + F(4)
    = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7
    = 15
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Output:
21
Explanation:
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1 + 2 = 3
F(3) = 1 + 3 = 4
F(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
F(5) = 1 + 5 = 6
ans = F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + F(4) + F(5)
    = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 6
    = 21
